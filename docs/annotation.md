# Roles, annotation and playback

## Who can do what
| | Not logged in | Facilitator (default) | Annotator |
|---|---|---|---|
| See published stories | yes | yes | yes |
| Collect, redact and upload stories | no | yes (saved as **drafts**) | yes |
| See their own drafts / delete their own stories | no | yes | own only |
| See every story, drafts included | no | no | yes |
| Transcribe, annotate, link images to moments, publish | no | **no** | yes |

Every new account is a facilitator. This is enforced by the database rules, not only by hiding
buttons. A story reaches the public only when an annotator presses **Publish for everyone**.

## Setup (once, in this order)
1. SQL editor: run `supabase/schema.sql`, then `supabase/annotations.sql`, then `supabase/roles.sql`
   (each is safe to run again). `roles.sql` creates the roles, makes existing stories published, and
   makes every existing account a facilitator.
2. Make someone an annotator (they sign up first, then you run this in the SQL editor):
   ```sql
   update public.profiles set role = 'annotator'
   where user_id = (select id from auth.users where email = 'person@example.com');
   ```
3. Optional fast transcription: see the Groq section below. Re-deploy `transcribe-media` after
   updating it, because it now checks that the caller is an annotator.

Note: uploaded files live in a public storage bucket under unguessable paths. Drafts are hidden from
every list and query, but anyone who is given a draft file's exact URL could open it.

## Annotator workflow
1. **Stories** (top left) lists every story with its status; open one without having to be nearby.
2. **Transcribe and annotate**: for each audio/video get a transcript, find or add terms, approve.
3. For each image (shown as a small thumbnail; tap it to open it larger in a popup): tick the terms it shows, optionally mark an area (**Mark area** opens the popup, drag on the image), and use **Link this image to a
   moment of the story**: choose the audio/video, pick a transcript line or set start/end (the small
   player has "Start/End = current time"), then **Add link**. An image can have several links.
   Each term on an audio/video row has a **Time** button: set when in the recording it applies (the
   player on that section has Start/End = current time), or choose **Whole recording**. Transcript-based
   suggestions start with their transcript line's range.
4. **Publish for everyone**.

## Exact seconds for suggestions
A term points at the seconds where its word is spoken, not at its whole transcript line:
- **Word timings** (Whisper on this device, or the Groq server option) are saved with each line
  (`transcript_segments.words`; run `roles.sql` once to add the column). Terms found in such a line get the exact
  range of the word, with a little padding.
- **No word timings** (typed text, `.srt`/`.vtt`, or a line you edited): the range is *estimated* from where the word sits
  in the line, with a minimum width of about 1 second. Check these; use **Time → Find exact seconds**, or set
  start/end with the player.
- **Set exact times for all suggestions** refines older suggestions that still cover the whole line. Anything
  you already adjusted is left alone.
- Editing a line's text in the box drops its word timings (they no longer match); re-run the transcription to get them back.

## What the public sees
- Every audio/video has a **timeline** under its player: amber bars are the parts linked to images, blue bars are the parts
  where a term applies. Tap a bar to play from there; the line follows the playback. Terms with no time range apply to the
  whole recording and have no bar.
- Image-only story: the image with its approved terms and marked areas.
- Story with audio/video: while it plays, the image linked to the current moment appears under the
  player (with its areas), together with the terms that apply to that moment. **Images tied to the story** lists each linked image with
  **▶ from mm:ss**: tapping it jumps the playback there. Transcript lines are tappable too.

# Transcription and vocabulary annotation

Owners transcribe the audio/video of their own stories and attach vocabulary terms.
Approved terms are public and exportable as JSON-LD. Everything runs in the page and in
your Supabase database: no server function and no paid API key.

## Setup (once)
Run `supabase/annotations.sql` in the Supabase SQL editor (after `schema.sql`). It is safe to
run again; it replaces its own policies, so run it again after pulling updates.

## Optional: free fast transcription on the server (Groq)
1. Create a free key at console.groq.com.
2. Supabase dashboard -> Edge Functions -> Secrets: add `GROQ_API_KEY`.
3. Edge Functions -> Deploy a new function -> Via Editor, name it exactly `transcribe-media`,
   paste `supabase/functions/transcribe-media/index.ts`, deploy (leave Verify JWT on).
The button **Transcribe on the server (free, fast)** then works. Files over 25 MB are
refused and the shared free quota can run out; the on-device and file options still work.

## Flow
Log in → open one of your stories → **Transcribe and annotate** → per audio/video:
1. Get a transcript: **Transcribe on the server** (if set up), or **Transcribe on this device (free)** runs Whisper in the browser
   (first use downloads ~250 MB, cached afterwards; slow on phones; nothing is uploaded),
   or **Load a .srt / .vtt / .txt file**, or type it. Edit freely. Format: one line per
   segment, optionally `[mm:ss-mm:ss] text`.
2. **Save transcript**, or **Save and find terms automatically**: capitalised words/names
   in each line are searched on Wikidata (the kind is guessed: person, place, event, concept).
3. For anything missing, use **+ Add a term** under a line: it searches Wikidata and Getty
   AAT/TGN/ULAN (Getty may be blocked by the browser; Wikidata still works). Pick the type
   and add it.
4. **Approve / Reject** automatic suggestions; fix the type if it was guessed wrong.
   Visitors see the transcript and approved terms; anyone can **Export JSON-LD**.

## Images
In **Transcribe and annotate**, each image of your story appears with the terms you have already
approved from the audio/video. Tick the ones the image shows. Optionally **Mark area** and drag a
box on the image (stored as fractions of its width/height, so it survives resizing).
**Suggest matches (on this device)** runs CLIP in the browser (first use downloads ~150 MB) and
pre-suggests up to 3 likely terms per image for you to approve or reject. It is experimental: it
works best for clear objects/places and compares against English labels. Visitors see approved terms
and boxes under the image; the JSON-LD export adds `HP9` / `P67 refers to` on the image and a
`xywh=percent:` fragment for boxes.

The automatic step is a simple name heuristic, not AI: it misses things and suggests wrong
matches, so review it. Re-saving replaces earlier *unreviewed* automatic suggestions;
approved/rejected and hand-added ones are kept. Lines without timestamps are stored without
a time range, and the export then links the whole media file instead of a time fragment.

## Mapping to the Heritage Digital Twin Ontology (ECHOES HDTO v0.1)
| App | HDTO / CRM |
|---|---|
| Story point | `HC1 Heritage Entity` → `HP1` → `HC2 Heritage Digital Twin` |
| Photo / video | `HC7 Digital Visual Object`, `HP22 represents` the entity |
| Audio | `HC5 Digital Representation`, `HP22 represents` |
| Spoken story | `nont:Narration` `HP4 narrates` a `nont:Narrative` (`HP2 has story`) |
| Transcript | `HC6 Digital Document` + `crm:E31`, `HP8` / `HP11` |
| Mentioned event | `HP10 tells about` → `crm:E5 Event` (HP10's range is events only) |
| Mentioned person / place / thing / type | `crm:P67 refers to` → `E21` / `E53` / `E70` / `E55` |
| Time-anchored tag | `oa:Annotation` with a media-fragment selector (`t=start,end`) |

`hdt:` has no official namespace in v0.1; the export uses `HDT_NS` from `config.js`
(`urn:echoes:hdto:`). Replace it when ECHOES publishes one, and verify the `nont:` namespace.
